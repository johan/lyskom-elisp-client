[rende: Irriterende fr}ga om password
------------------------------------------------------------
Jag p}pekde denna bugg i ett tidigare inl{gg men den verkar inte ha
blivit fixad.  N{r man startar om kom och har en gammal kombuffert
kvar s} fr}gar kom efter password trots att man skickar med detta som
argument.

Jag startar kom med:

(defun kom ()
  (interactive)
  (lyskom "obel18" "Tommy Persson" lyskom-passwd))

Also check that the server never sends any who-infos any more.  It
should be obsoleted by now.

I have already done some of the functions i.e. the ones that I have
ended up with errors in. All of the handlers must be fixed.
