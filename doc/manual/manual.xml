  <!-- There is a bit of magic going on here. Each chapter is a   -->
  <!-- self-contained DocBook file with one and only one chapter. -->
  <!-- The makefile will take care of extracting that chapter to  -->
  <!-- a file with the same name, but suffixed with .inc. The     -->
  <!-- makefile will also create chp.xml, which defines entities  -->
  <!-- for all chapters, and defines the chapter entity to expand -->
  <!-- to all chapters. The fnc.ent and var.ent files are created -->
  <!-- by docgen.el, also from the makefile. You should only have -->
  <!-- to concern yourself with writing DocBook.                  -->
