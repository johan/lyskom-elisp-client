2.2 After installing

    After installing you can set Emacs to load LysKOM automatically.

    1. Set up autoloading by adding the following line to your .emacs
       or any other file that Emacs loads at startup (such as
       ~/.emacs, site-start.el or default.el):

            (autoload 'lyskom "lyskom" "Start LysKOM" t)

    2. If you have your own LysKOM server you may want to modify the
       variable kom-server-aliases. The best place to change it is in
       your site init file (default.el or site-start.el). For example,
       if you are running a server on kom.domain.org, you might want
       to say something like this in your init file:

            (defvar kom-server-aliases 
                    '(("kom.domain.org     . "DomainKOM")
                      ("kom.lysator.liu.se . "LysKOM")))

       The first server listed in kom-server-aliases will be the
       default server for new users.

    3. Restart Emacs. You should be able to use the command lyskom
       (M-x l y s k o m RET) to start the client. Enjoy!


3.  Reporting bugs and requesting new features

    Before reporting a bug, please check that it is not one of the
    known issues below. Please report bugs by posting them to the
    bugzilla at <URL:http://bugzilla.lysator.liu.se/>. If you are
    unable or unwilling to use bugzilla, you can e-mail bug reports
    and feature requests to bug-lyskom@lysator.liu.se instead.

    To evaluate your bug report we need the following information:

    o   The LysKOM version you are using. This is shown when you start
        LysKOM and is also contained in the Emacs lisp variable
        lyskom-clientversion.

    o   The symptoms of the bug. Please be as detailed as possible.
        Please do not try to make conclusions. Just give us the facts.

    o   How you triggered the bug. If you know how to reproduce it,
        please tell us. We're really good at quickly fixing bugs we
        can reproduce.

    o   How you started Emacs, what variables you have changed and
        which packages you have loaded. If possible, try to reproduce
        the bug with Emacs started with the -q command line switch.

    The command kom-bug-report may come in handy. It gives us a lot of
    information that you might not think of (such as what the internal
    data structures look like). If you post a bug report to our
    bugzilla, please make the result of kom-bug-report an *attachment*
    to your bug report.


4. Known issues

   Please read the file NEWS-@@CLIENTVERSION@@ for more information on
   these and other issues and for information on changes in this
   version.


   Issue:  I have to re-read every FAQ even though I've read them
           before!

   Reason: Yeah, but that's the way it is. It'll only happen once.
           In order to improve FAQ handling in the latest client
           version we had to record read FAQs separately from read
           texts, and no such record exists for FAQs you read before
           upgrading. Sorry about that.

   Issue:  Cannot enter conference names containing international
           characters.

   Reason: You may be using a different character coding than the
           server is using, and conversion to the server's coding is
           not working. For example, many versions of Emacs are unable
           to convert from iso-8859-15 (latin-9) to iso-8859-1
           (latin-1) even though most characters are the same.

           Switching to the character coding used by the server by
           using set-language-environment (usually to Latin-1) will
           fix this problem. If you are unwilling to do this, you can
           try loading the ucs-tables Emacs library (a version of this
           file is available from <URL:http://www.lysator.liu.se/
           lyskom/klienter/emacslisp/>).


   Issue:  Problems displaying many normal-looking texts.

   Reason: Recent versions of some Linux distributions encourage users
           to use the latin9 language environment, which results in
           texts coded using iso-8859-15. If you do not have fonts
           suitable for displaying this character coding you may
           experience some problems with such texts. To fix this
           problem, install fonts suitable for displaying iso-8859-15
           characters. You may also be able to fix it by loading
           either the ucs-tables or the latin-unity Emacs library
           (a version of ucs-tables is available from <URL:http://www.
           lysator.liu.se/lyskom/klienter/emacslisp/> and latin-unity
           is available from the XEmacs package system).


   Issue:  I see \201 before international characters in the string
           showing what some other user is doing (e.g. L\201äser).

   Reason: The user is probably using an old version of the client in
           a new version of Emacs. You can confirm this by using the
           command kom-list-clients (Lista klienter, List clients).


   Issue:  I get the message "Key sequence < m o u s e - 2 > uses
           invalid prefix characters" when I load lyskom.elc.

   Reason: You have a file named macedit.el or macedit.elc installed.
           Remove this file.


   Issue:  Columns containing Swedish characters or characters in
           numeric representation are not aligned correctly.

   Reason: This happens in certain versions of Emacs when running
           without multi-byte character support and is due to bugs in
           Emacs. The only workaround is to either upgrade Emacs or
           enable multi-byte character support.


   Issue:  Swedish characters show up as blanks, question marks or
           numbers.

   Reason: If Swedish characters show up as blanks your font probably
           does not support them. If they show up as question marks or
           numbers your language environment does not support them or
           you are lacking the fonts to display them.

           Make sure that your language environment is set correctly
           with set-language-environment. Just setting the environment
           variable LC_CTYPE to the proper value (iso_8859_1 is
           usually correct) should be enough.

           Do not use standard-display-european to fix this problem.
