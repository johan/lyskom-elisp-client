This variable defines patterns to look for in text and convert to
links to URLs. The value of this variable must be an alist, where the
key (car) is a conference number and the value (cdr) is a list of link
specifications for that conference. The special value `t' for the key
indicates a list of patterns to apply in all conferences. Key values
other than positive integers and `t' are reserved for future use.

Each link specification is in turn a list \(`PATTERN' `REPLACEMENT'
`HIGHLIGHT' `IGNORE-CASE'), where `PATTERN' is a regular expression to
look for in the text, `REPLACEMENT' is used to generate a URL from the
text matching `PATTERN', `HIGHLIGHT' is the pattern group to highlight
as a URL and `IGNORE-CASE' specifies whether matching is
case-sensitive or not.

Each text is examined for each `PATTERN'. If a match is found, a URL
is created from `REPLACEMENT'. All characters except \ are copied
verbatim. The backslash character starts one of the following
sequences:

    Sequence    Meaning
    \&          Substitute the matched text

The `HIGHLIGHT' parameter specifies which (...) group in `PATTERN'
to highlight as an URL. Use `0' to highlight the entire match.

Finally, if `IGNORE-CASE' is `t', then ignore character case while
looking for `PATTERN'. Values other than `t' and `nil' are reserved
for future use.

When a text has more than one recipient, links will be generated for
all recipients. The order in which the recipients are examined and
the priority among links that match the same text is undefined."

  "**Defines how prefix arguments are used by commands to find a text to operate on.

The keys \(cars) of the list are either one of the functions that
invoke `lyskom-read-text-no-prefix-arg' or the value `t' for the
strategy common to all such functions. For functions in the list, the
strategy is chosen from the cdr of that entry and, if and when no
matching rule was found that way, from the common strategy.

Each value \(cdr) of the list is an alist specifying how to do when
mapping a prefix argument to a text number.

The keys \(cars) of this alist are the predicates for which the values
\(cdrs) map functions that retrieve the text number to operate on.
Each predicate is tested in turn on the prefix argument, and when one
returns non-nil, the cdr gets invoked. This process is repeated until
all predicates have been tested or a cdr returned a non-nil value,
whichever comes first. If you like, the cars can also be the actual
prefix-arg values (-, 0 or nil, for example) that you want to invoke
some special rule for. The value `t' means that the behaviour given by
the cdr stipulates the default value for the prompt, when one is
shown.

The cdrs on the list may be either of:

* a function, in which case it gets called with four parameters: the
  prefix argument, the `PROMPT' that would be used to ask the user for a
  text number, a (possibly nil) `DEFAULT' choice for that prompt, and a
  `CONSTRAINT' value, all as provided in the call to
  `lyskom-read-text-no-prefix-arg' (see its docs). Returning a positive
  integer means return that text number. Returning a common lyskom
  format string aborts, showing your helpful error description. A
  `nil' return value means try the next rule to get a text number.

* a list of two functions, optionally followed by additional list items,
  in which case the second function is called to change the prefix argument
  parameter for the first function, which is then called as above. Any extra
  items on the argument list will be appended to its argument list. Hence, a
  `\(my-get-text-no abs 17 4711)' entry would result in the following call:
  `\(funcall my-get-text-no (abs prefix-arg) prompt default nil 17 4711)'."

URL according to `REPLACEMENT'.

All characters in `REPLACEMENT' except \ are copied verbatim. The
backslash character starts one of the following sequences:

    Sequence    Meaning
    \&          Substitute the matched text
    \N          Substitute match for text matching the Nth (...)

When an incoming message arrives and the auto-reply facility is on,
this list is checked for automatic replies. The message type, sender,
recipient and text of the incoming messages is matched against the 
elements of this list. If a match is found, the corresponding reply is
send. A nil in one of the message-type, sender, recipient or text
components in the list is taken to mean a wildcard. A null reply means
don't send a reply.

TYPE is the button type the entry defines
LABEL is a textual representation for the button type, used in menu titles. If
      it is a symbol, that symbol will be looked up using lyskom-get-string.
DEFAULT is the default action to take on a click. It must be a function.
ACTIONS are other possible actions. The format of this entry is described

HINTS is a list of hints to override the default action. This is described 
      below.

The ACTIONS entry is used to construct a pop-up menu. It is a list consisting 
of lists with the format (STRING . FUNCTION). STRING is the menu label and
FUNCTION is the function to call when the menu item is selected.

The HINTS entry is used to generate hints that the default action should be 
overridden. It is a list containing elements (COMMAND . HINT) where COMMAND is
as interactive LysKOM command and HINT is a function to call. When a button
is generated while the command COMMAND is being executed, HINT is used as a 
hint for a new default action. The user has the option to ignore or used the 
hint.
