The LysKOM project is conducted at the Lysator CC at the
Linköping institute of Technology.

The developers are interested in any improvements you do in the code
so please make sure they get a copy of your fixes/enhancements. Upload
them to Bugzilla at <http://bugzilla.lysator.liu.se/>, or email them
to <kom@lysator.liu.se>.
