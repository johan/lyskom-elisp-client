1.  REQUIREMENTS

    You need an Emacs. The client appears to work with the following
    versions of Emacs:

    * XEmacs version 20.4, 21.1 and 21.2.
    * Gnu Emacs version 19.34 [1]
    * Gnu Emacs version 20.5 and newer [2]

    [1] You'll have to replace the included custom package, and if you 
        use Gnus, you may have to update that as well.

    [2] It should be possible to run the client in Gnu Emacs 20.2 and
        later, but you may experience some additional problems. Column
        alignment is known to fail in version 20.2.


    There are also some requirements on supplemental elisp packages:

    * custom

      You need to have a recent version of the custom package
      installed. The custom.el file that is bundled with Gnu Emacs
      19.34 and older versions of Gnus will not work.

      The version that is bundled with recent versions of XEmacs, with
      Gnu Emacs 20, with recent versions of Gnus and w3 is the one you
      need.

      Custom is not longer distributed as a separate package, but it
      may be available at <URL:http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/
      custom/>. An old version is available in the elisp-client ftp
      directory at <URL:ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/lyskom/elisp-
      client/>.

      If you have a version of Gnus installed that uses the old custom
      package, it's time to upgrade. The latest version of Gnus is
      available from <URL:http://www.gnus.org/>.

    * You must NOT HAVE macedit.el

      Make sure you do not have a file called macedit.el early in your
      load path. This file redefines a function that the client relies
      heavly on. The redefinition is buggy. You can recognize this
      problem if your Emacs says something like this: "Key sequence <
      m o u s e - 2 > uses invalid prefix characters" when you load or
      compile the elisp client.

    * w3 4.0 or later (optional)

      LysKOM can use w3 for displaying HTML. At the time of writing
      this, the latest version of W3 is 4.0. It is available from
      <URL:http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/w3.html> and included in
      many distributions of Emacs. If w3 is not installed, LysKOM will
      be unable to display HTML.
    
    * calc (optional)

      LysKOM uses calc to implement the "Compute" command. If you want
      to use it you need calc. The latest version of calc, as of
      writing this, is available at <URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
      calc/calc-2.02f.tar.gz>


3.  Installation

    You will have received the client in a compressed tar archive or
    in a zip file. The archive contains all the files needed to build
    the client and a pre-built client.

    The client is also available as an RPM (for RedHat, Mandrake,
    Gentus and other RedHat-based Linux distributions) and a Debian
    package. These assume that you are using Gnu Emacs 20.5 or later.

    You can either install manually (see section 3.1) or using the
    Makefile (section 3.3). However you install, there are a few
    additional steps that you may want to follow to facilitate using
    the client (section 3.3).


3.1 Manual installation

    This procedure should work on any system, including Windows.

    1. Compile the client with the command `emacs -batch -f
       batch-byte-compile-file lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.el' 

       You may see some warnings when you compile. Most of these can
       be ignored. When compilation is done you should have a new file
       named lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.elc located in the same directory as
       lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.el.

    2. Copy lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.elc to where you want to install
       the client and either rename the file lyskom.elc or create a
       symbolic link from lyskom.elc to lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.elc. 

       If possible you should place it in your site-lisp directory. 
       Check the value of load-path (C-h v l o a d - p a t h RET) to
       see possible locations.


3.2 Using the Makefile

    If you are on a Unix-like system (or anything that supports
    Makefiles) you can use make to install the client. You have to use
    the Makefile method if you want to change the list of available
    languages.


    1. Edit the Makefile in the distribution to reflect your
       environment. You can change the following variables:

          EMACS should be set to the command used to start Emacs. 
          Usually this will be either `emacs' or `xemacs'.

          LISPDIR is the directory in which the compiled and
          uncompiled client will go. This will normally be set to your
          site-lisp directory.

          INFODIR is where the info files will go, once we've written
          them. You should set this variable on the off chance that we
          distributed some documentation with the code.

          LANGUAGES is a list of languages to compile in. As of version
          0.46 there are only two translations of LysKOM. The Makefile
          states which values are legal. Just list all the languages
          you want, separated by whitespace. The first language you
          specify will be the default language.

    2. Run `make envcheck' to make sure your Emacs environment is set
       up correctly. The environment check does not read your .emacs,
       so it will not find libraries that are not in the default load
       path. This means that it is possible that LysKOM will run just
       fine for you even if it complains.

    3. Edit the file lpath.el if you need to change the default load
       path for compiling (this should only happen if the custom
       package is not on your default load path).

    4. If you changed the list of languages, run `make clean'.

    5. Run `make'. If your environment is set up correctly, LysKOM
       should be compiled. When compilation is finished, type `make
       install' to copy all the relevant files to the relevant places. 
       If you do `make install' without just doing `make', you'll
       bypass the environment check.


3.3 After installing

    After installing you can set Emacs to load LysKOM automatically.

    1. Set up autoloading by adding the following line to your .emacs
       or any other file that Emacs loads at startup (such as
       site-start.el or default.el):

            (autoload 'lyskom "lyskom" "Start LysKOM" t)

    2. If you have your own LysKOM server you may want to modify the
       variable kom-server-aliases. The best place to change it is in
       your site init file (default.el or site-start.el). For example,
       if you are running a server on kom.domain.org, you might want
       to say something like this in your init file:
   
            (defvar kom-server-aliases 
                    '(("kom.domain.org     . "DomainKOM")
                      ("kom.lysator.liu.se . "LysKOM")))
   
       The first server listed in kom-server-aliases will be the
       default server for new users.


    3. Restart Emacs. You should be able to use the command lyskom
       (M-x l y s k o m RET) to start the client. Enjoy!




4.  Reporting Bugs

    Before reporting a bug, please check that it is not one of the
    known issues below. Report bugs to bug-lyskom@lysator.liu.se. 
    Please give us the following information (at least):

    o   The LysKOM version you are using. This is shown when you start
        LysKOM and is also contained in the variable
        lyskom-clientversion.

    o   The symptoms of the bug. Please be as detailed as possible.
        Please do not try to make conclusions. Just give us the facts.

    o   How you triggered the bug. If you know how to reproduce it,
        please tell us. We're pretty good at fixing bugs we can
        reproduce.

    o   How you started Emacs, what variables you have changed and
        which packages you have loaded. If possible, try to  reproduce
        the bug with Emacs started with the -q command line switch.

    The command kom-bug-report may come in handy. It gives us a lot of 
    information that you might not think of (such as what the internal 
    data structures look like.)



5. Known issues

   Issue:  I see \201 before swedish characters in the string showing
           what some other user is doing (e.g. L\201äser).

   Reason: The user is probably using an old version of the client in
           a new version of Emacs. You can confirm this by using the
           command kom-list-clients (Lista klienter, List clients).


   Issue:  I get the message "Key sequence < m o u s e - 2 > uses
           invalid prefix characters" when I load lyskom.elc.

   Reason: You have a file named macedit.el or macedit.elc installed.
           Remove this file.


   Issue:  I get the "Symbol's value as variable is void: \," when I
           try to run lyskom. 

   Reason: You have loaded the uncompiled client (e.g. lyskom.el or
           lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.el). Compile the client and load the compiled
           file (e.g. lyskom.elc or lyskom-@@CLIENTVERSION@@.elc).


   Issue:  Columns containing swedish characters or characters in
           numeric representation are not aligned correctly.

   Reason: This happens in certain versions of Emacs when running
           without multibyte character support and is due to bugs in
           Emacs. The only workaround is to either upgrade Emacs or
           enable multibyte character support.


   Issue:  Swedish characters show up as blanks, question marks or
           numbers.

   Reason: If swedish characters show up as blanks your font probably
           does not support them. If they show up as question marks or
           numbers your language environment does not support them.

           Make sure that your language environment is set correctly
           with set-language-environment. Just setting the environment
           variable LC_CTYPE to the proper value (iso_8859_1 is
           usually correct) should be enough.

           Do not use standard-display-european to fix this problem.
