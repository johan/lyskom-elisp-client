1.  Prerequisites

    To use LysKOM you need an Emacs. Specifically, you need Gnu Emacs
    version 19.34 or XEmacs, version 19.15 or 20.2 or higher. It is
    possible that LysKOM will work with older versions of Emacs, but if 
    it does, it's purely coincidence.

    You also need the custom package from Per Abrahamsen. You can pick
    it up at <URL:http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>. Note that
    if you have an older version of Gnus installed, it is possible that 
    you already have a file named custom.el. If this is the case,
    you'll have to upgrade Gnus as well. More recent versions of Gnus
    use the same version of custom that LysKOM uses.

    You should have w3 version 3.somthing installed. LysKOM will work
    without it, but won't be able to format HTML code.

    To make things simpler, just type `make envcheck' in the
    distribution directory, and the script will tell you if there seem
    to be any problems with your Emacs environment.




2.  Installation

    Edit the Makefile in the distribution to reflect your environment. 
    You can change the following variables:

        EMACS should be set to the command used to start Emacs. Usually 
        this will be either emacs or xemacs.

        LISPDIR is the directory in which the compiled and uncompiled
        client will go. This will normally be set to your site-lisp
        directory.

        INFODIR is where the info files will go, once we've written
        them. You should set this variable on the off chance that we
        distributed some documentation with the code.

        LANGUAGES is a list of languages to compile in. As of version
        0.45 there are only two translations of LysKOM. The Makefile
        states which values are legal. Just list all the languages you
        want, separated by whitespace. The first language you specify
        will be the default language.

    Type `make envcheck' to make sure your Emacs environment is set up
    correctly. 

    If you need to add anything to the default load path, edit the
    file lpath.el.

    Type `make'. If your environment is set up correctly, LysKOM
    should be compiled. When compilation is finished, type `make
    install' to copy all the relevant files to the relevant places.

    Start Emacs, load lyskom.elc and type M-x lyskom RET, and you
    should be in business.

    If you have your own LysKOM server you may want to modify the
    variable kom-server-aliases. The best place to change it is in your 
    site init file. For example, if you are running a server on
    kom.domain.org, you might want to say something like this in your
    init file:

         (defvar kom-server-aliases 
                 '(("kom.domain.org     . "DomainKOM")
                   ("kom.lysator.liu.se . "LysKOM")))

    The first server listed in kom-server-aliases will be the default
    server for new users.




3.  Reporting Bugs

    Please report bugs to bug-lyskom@lysator.liu.se. Please give us the 
    following information (at least):

    o   The LysKOM version you are using. This is shown when you start
        LysKOM and is also contained in the variable
        lyskom-clientversion.

    o   The symptoms of the bug. Please be as detailed as possible.
        Please do not try to make conclusions. Just give us the facts.

    o   How you triggered the bug. If you know how to reproduce it,
        please tell us. We're pretty good at fixing bugs we can
        reproduce.

    For your convenience, you may use the command kom-bug-report to
    report bugs to us.
