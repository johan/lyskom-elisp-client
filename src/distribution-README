1.  What do I need

    You need an Emacs. The client appears to work with the following
    versions of Emacs:

    * XEmacs version 20.4, 21.1 and 21.2.
    * Gnu Emacs version 19.34 [1]
    * Gnu Emacs version 20.5 and newer [2]

    [1] You'll have to replace the included custom package, and if you 
        use Gnus, you may have to update that as well.

    [2] It should be possible to run the client in Gnu Emacs 20.2 and
        later, but you may experience some problems. Column alignment
        is known to fail in version 20.2.

    You need to have a recent version of the custom package installed.
    The custom.el file that is bundled with Gnu Emacs 19.34 and older
    versions of Gnus will not work.

    The version that is bundled with recent versions of XEmacs, with
    Gnu Emacs 20, with recent versions of Gnus and w3 is the one you 
    need. 

    Custom is not longer distributed as a separate package, but it may
    be available at <URL:http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>. An
    old version is available in the elisp-client ftp directory at
    <URL:ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/lyskom/elisp-client/>.

    If you have a version of Gnus installed that uses the old custom
    package, it's time to upgrade. The latest version of Gnus is
    available from <URL:http://www.gnus.org/>.

    MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE a file called macedit.el early in your
    load path. This file redefines a function that the client relies
    heavly on. The redefinition is buggy. You can recognize this
    problem if your Emacs says something like this: "Key sequence < m
    o u s e - 2 > uses invalid prefix characters".



2.  What should I have

    LysKOM can use w3 for displaying HTML and calc for performing
    calculations. Neither package is required, but since they are
    useful in their own right you might as well install them anyway.

    At the time of writing this, the latest version of W3 is 4.0. It
    is available from <URL:http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/w3.html>
    
    The latest version of calc, when writing this, is available at
    <URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/calc/calc-2.02f.tar.gz>


3.  Installation

    There are two ways to install the client. You can assemble,
    compile and install it from a tar file, or from a single emacs
    lisp file. 

    If you are using a Unix system (or something sufficiently
    similar), try installing from the tar file. If you are using
    Microsoft Windows, install using the single file.


3.1 Installation from the tar file

    Edit the Makefile in the distribution to reflect your environment. 
    You can change the following variables:

        EMACS should be set to the command used to start Emacs. Usually 
        this will be either emacs or xemacs.

        LISPDIR is the directory in which the compiled and uncompiled
        client will go. This will normally be set to your site-lisp
        directory.

        INFODIR is where the info files will go, once we've written
        them. You should set this variable on the off chance that we
        distributed some documentation with the code.

        LANGUAGES is a list of languages to compile in. As of version
        0.45 there are only two translations of LysKOM. The Makefile
        states which values are legal. Just list all the languages you
        want, separated by whitespace. The first language you specify
        will be the default language.

    Type `make envcheck' to make sure your Emacs environment is set up
    correctly. The environment check is somewhat pessimistic. It is
    entirely possible that LysKOM will run just fine even if it
    complains.

    If you need to add anything to the default load path for
    compiling, edit the file lpath.el.

    Type `make'. If your environment is set up correctly, LysKOM
    should be compiled. When compilation is finished, type `make
    install' to copy all the relevant files to the relevant places. If
    you do `make install' without just doing `make', you'll bypass the
    environment check, which is probably not a good idea.

    Start Emacs, load lyskom.elc and type M-x lyskom RET, and you
    should be in business.

    If you have your own LysKOM server you may want to modify the
    variable kom-server-aliases. The best place to change it is in your 
    site init file. For example, if you are running a server on
    kom.domain.org, you might want to say something like this in your
    init file:

         (defvar kom-server-aliases 
                 '(("kom.domain.org     . "DomainKOM")
                   ("kom.lysator.liu.se . "LysKOM")))

    The first server listed in kom-server-aliases will be the default
    server for new users.



3.2.  Installation from a single .el file

    If you have received the client as a single file named
    lyskom-0.46.el or something similar, first rename the file to
    lyskom.el. Make sure that the custom package is in the default
    load path (they are if you're using XEmacs 19.15 or later, or Gnu
    Emacs 20.1 or later.) To compile, simply issue the following
    commend:

        emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile lyskom.el

    This will create a file named lyskom.elc which should be placed
    somewhere where Emacs will find it.



4.  Reporting Bugs

    Please report bugs to bug-lyskom@lysator.liu.se. Please give us the 
    following information (at least):

    o   The LysKOM version you are using. This is shown when you start
        LysKOM and is also contained in the variable
        lyskom-clientversion.

    o   The symptoms of the bug. Please be as detailed as possible.
        Please do not try to make conclusions. Just give us the facts.

    o   How you triggered the bug. If you know how to reproduce it,
        please tell us. We're pretty good at fixing bugs we can
        reproduce.

    o   How you started Emacs, what variables you have changed and
        which packages you have loaded. If possible, try to  reproduce
        the bug with Emacs started with the -q command line switch.

    The command kom-bug-report may come in handy. It gives us a lot of 
    information that you might not think of (such as what the internal 
    data structures look like.)
