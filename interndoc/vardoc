Variable documentation strings that are intended for inclusion in the
printed manual must follow these conventions.

* The docstring must start with two asterisks.

* Literal strings will possibly be italicized. They may span lines.

* Code and cross references are indicated with `'

  `kom-<something>'    --- Cross-reference to variable or command
  `lyskom-<something>' --- Cross-reference to variable or command
  `<UPPERCASE>'        --- Format as a replaceable
  `<anything>'         --- Format as a constant
  non-nil              --- Special case for nil

* To insert a table indent the block from the left, and make second
  and last lines all dashes. Rows are separated with empty lines. Be
  careful to start multi-line cells all on the same column. Watch out
  for the effects of escaped characters in earlier cells.
  The table ends at the second all-dash line.

* Indicate blocks of preformatted text with a line consisting of a
  single unindented < before and > after.

* Indicate bulleted lists with * at the start of the paragraph. Each
  bullet item may consist of a single paragraph only.
